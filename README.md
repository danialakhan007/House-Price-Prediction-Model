**Overview**

This project presents a comprehensive approach to predicting house prices through data exploration, preprocessing, and feature engineering. 
The primary goal is to develop an accurate and reliable prediction model using both Linear Regression and Random Forest algorithms.
The project utilizes popular Python libraries such as pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, seaborn, and matplotlib.

**Key Features**
1. Data Exploration
The project begins with a detailed exploration of the dataset, aiming to gain insights into the distribution of key features, identify outliers, and understand the relationships between variables.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) techniques are employed to visualize patterns and trends that can influence house prices.

3. Data Preprocessing
This phase involves handling missing values, addressing outliers, and encoding categorical variables.
Additionally, feature scaling and normalization techniques are applied to ensure optimal model performance.

5. Feature Engineering
New features are created, and existing features are transformed to capture meaningful patterns in the data. This step aims to improve the model's ability to generalize to unseen data.

6. Model Selection
The project compares the performance of two widely used regression models: Linear Regression and Random Forest. Both models are implemented using the scikit-learn library. The evaluation metrics, including mean absolute error, mean squared error, and R-squared, are utilized to assess the models' effectiveness in predicting house prices.

7. Libraries Used
pandas: For data manipulation and analysis.
numpy: For numerical operations and array handling.
scikit-learn: For implementing machine learning models and evaluation metrics.
seaborn: For advanced data visualization.
matplotlib: For creating static, interactive, and animated visualizations.
